- ðŸ”­ I previously worked as a research assistant at IWFM, BUET, working on the backend of a project to visualize water levels using Google Maps API.
- ðŸ”Ž My area of research interest is primarily in software engineering, with a focus on **developer wellbeing**. In our research we try to improve everyday developer workflows as efficiently as possible using cutting edge technologies such as language models.
- ðŸ§¬ My undergraduate thesis was in the field of bioinformatics. There, I applied machine learning techniques on spatial transcriptomics (Slide-Seq) data to unveil new pathways for cell-cell communication using robust statistical methods to back our findings.
